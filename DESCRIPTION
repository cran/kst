Description: Knowledge space theory by Doignon and Falmagne (1999) 
   <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58625-5> is a set- and order-theoretical
   framework, which proposes mathematical formalisms to operationalize 
   knowledge structures in a particular domain. The 'kst' package provides 
   basic functionalities to generate, handle, and manipulate knowledge 
   structures and knowledge spaces.
